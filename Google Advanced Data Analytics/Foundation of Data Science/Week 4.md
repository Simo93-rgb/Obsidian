# The data project workflow
## Welcome to Week 4
We began our journey into the data professional world by covering the basics of data science, exploring careers, and discussing skills needed to succeed. In this section, we'll investigate the workflow within data-driven careers. You'll be introduced to a helpful organizational tool called the ***PACE*** model, that can provide structure while allowing great flexibility when working on projects. We'll explore the elements of effective communication and some best practices when sharing your ideas with others. All of these skills and tools will help you prepare for your upcoming portfolio project. I know you're excited to continue. Let's get started.

## Introduction to PACE
**Preparation is the key!**
![[Pasted image 20230522153328.png]]
Pace framework means:
- **Plan**: Define de scope of the project, involves defining project goals, strategies, and potential impacts.
- **Analyze**: Engage with the data, includes acquiring, cleaning, and transforming data, and conducting an exploratory data analysis.
- **Construct**: collaborate with other data professionals to build models and uncover data relationships.
- **Execute**: involves presenting findings, answering questions, and incorporating feedback.

This process isn't strictly linear, and revisits to previous stages may be needed based on new information. Communication is key throughout the process, likened to the flow of electricity in a circuit. The PACE framework's adaptability prepares professionals for a dynamic field requiring flexibility and effective communication. Through using the PACE framework, one can continually hone their skills and develop a personal workflow.
Let's digging into it.

### PLAN
At the beginning of a project, it is important to establish a solid foundation for success. Here you will define the scope of your project. This is when you will begin by identifying the informational needs of the organization. During the planning stage, you will have the widest viewpoint of a project. By assessing all of the factors and processes involved, you are mapping a path to completion, using your creativity to conceptualize a course of action. Here you will also take special note of tasks that may require an innovative approach within your workflow.

**Summary**: The planning stage is where you conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide you through the process of completing a project.

Here are a few examples of the types of planning stage tasks:

-   Research business data
    
-   Define the project scope
    
-   Develop a workflow
    
-   Assess project and/or stakeholder needs

### Analyze
In the analyzing stage, you will interact with the data for the first time. Here you will acquire all of the data you will need for the project. Some datasets could come from primary sources within your organization. Others may need to be collected from secondary sources outside your company. You may even find that you need governmental or open source data. The analyzing stage is also where you will engage in exploratory data analysis or EDA. This involves cleaning, reorganizing and analyzing all of the necessary data for the project.

**Summary**: The analyzing stage is where you will collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project.

Here are a few examples of the types of analyzing stage tasks:

-   Format database
    
-   Scrub data
    
-   Convert data into usable formats

### Construct
Just as the name suggests, the construction stage is all about building. In this stage of PACE, you will be building, interpreting, and revising models. Some projects will require machine learning algorithms to uncover correlations within your data. You will use these correlations to uncover information from the data that would otherwise go unused. These relationships can help your organization make informed decisions about the future.

**Summary**: In the construction stage you will build models that will allow you access to hidden relationships locked within data.

Here are a few examples of the types of construction stage tasks:

-   Select modeling approach
    
-   Build models
    
-   Build machine learning algorithms

### Execute
In the execution stage, you will put your analysis and construction into action. Here you will deliver your findings to the internal (inside of your organization) and external (outside of your organization) stakeholders. Quite often, this will involve stakeholders from the business-side of the companies you are working with. Presenting your findings is only a part of the execution stage. Stakeholders will provide feedback, ask questions, and make recommendations that you will collect and incorporate.

**Summary**: In the execution stage you will present the finding of your analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.

Here are a few examples of execution stage tasks:

-   Share results
    
-   Present findings to other stakeholders
    
-   Address feedback

# Elements of Communication
## Key elements of communication
![[Pasted image 20230522162052.png]]
Effective communication is pivotal in a data professional's role. In every communicative exchange, there are three key elements: purpose, receiver, and sender.

1. **Purpose**: This is the reason for communication. In data-focused settings, the purpose could be technical, requiring analysis or reporting, or strategic, guiding a company's financial or organizational efforts.
2. **Receiver**: This is the audience for the message. When crafting communication, it's helpful to consider what the audience already knows and what they need to know. Remember that every exchange can initiate a chain of events, especially as data professionals often work as part of a distributed team across an organization.
3. **Sender**: This is the person crafting the message. As the sender, you should consider your relationship to the receiver, your role in the exchange (are you reporting insights, pitching ideas, identifying potential data inputs), and any personal biases that might affect your message.

The interplay between these three elements impacts the message you intend to share. The same message may need to be presented in different ways depending on the purpose and the receiver. For instance, a data professional may explain a project differently to non-technical audiences, focusing more on the impact, versus technical colleagues, where they might detail the code and project logistics. Understanding these communication elements and tailoring your message accordingly sets you up for success in your future job.
## Top data professional communication practices
Communication is important. It flows through each stage of PACE, whether collecting data, constructing models or sharing results. Regardless of where you are within the PACE  framework, revision and clarification are part of a thoughtful analysis. Throughout the stages of  PACE, stakeholders can offer feedback, pose questions, or ask for clarification. Here are five best practices to guide your communications through any stage of the PACE framework.
### 1. Speak the language of your audience
Identify the needs of your audience. It is important to know the objectives of the person you are communicating with. Focusing on their needs allows you to gain insight and assess how technical the conversation should be. Consider the following questions:
-   Why has this person contacted you?
-   What does your stakeholder want from this interaction?
-   What’s important to them, their team, or their organization?
In your role as a data professional, you will interact with a variety of stakeholders. When speaking to another data professional, the exchange can go deeper into technical concepts. When sharing information with an executive who may not be familiar with those more technical aspects of your work, you need to consider what is important to someone in an executive role. Determine what they know, what they need to know, and what might go beyond their level of involvement in a project. 
-   Break down technical concepts into simpler terms. 
-   Use shorter sentences so main ideas are easier to understand and remember.
-   Use direct language and minimize embellishments or unnecessary detail.
-   Pay attention to diverse backgrounds and respect the lived experiences of others.

**Pro tip**: Avoid jargon, acronyms, and technical “buzzwords” that could lead to confusion.
### 2. Invite questions and welcome feedback
A data professional in the workplace must expect feedback and questions. Since your recommendations can have an impact on the future decisions of your company and its employees, it is natural to want your work to be perfect. The reality is that everyone can use feedback–whether it is positive or points out areas for improvement. When you are deep into a task, focused on the details, it is possible to overlook something. Feedback is essential since no single person can envision every possible perspective. Another person’s feedback offers you a great way to gather insights for your personal growth and professional excellence. By accepting the challenge that feedback and questions present, you will strengthen your own skills and help the overall project.
-   Merge your passion for finding solutions with the goals of the project.
-   Continue to strive for greater understanding of the results.
-   Elicit feedback and questions to improve communication about your projects.
-   Consider opportunities to reflect on your communication skills.

**Pro tip**: Analyze feedback. Is it valid? Does the person have a complete understanding of the goals of the project or data analytical process? If not, set up an additional meeting to help clarify.
### 3. Be the connection to the data
You are your team’s direct connection to the insights your data offers. Your goal is to help other stakeholders understand the process and how it addresses their needs. When everyone understands the process, communication can be highly effective.
-   Focus on the objectives to help others better understand your data process.
-   Tell the story of the data with a compelling and cohesive narrative.
-   Respond to questions in a timely manner.
-   Demonstrate your value to the team. 
-   Find opportunities to address stakeholder questions.

**Pro tip**: Continue to proactively identify ways the data and tools you have access to can address the objectives of your team and drive new insights.
### 4. Let your visualizations help tell the story
Visualizations are one of the best ways to communicate ideas, especially when dealing with big data. Visual references help bring to life the details inside your data. Graphs, charts and infographics can promote general understanding. Later you will explore Tableau, a visualization tool that you can use to create compelling visuals from data.
-   Be sure that your visuals tell the story within the data.
-   Design visualizations for inclusivity.
-   Use labels and text to clarify, not clutter. Use fonts that are easy to read.
-   Use high contrast, shading, and other customizations to communicate your messages clearly.
-   Offer handouts, slides, and other material in accessible formats.

**Pro tip**: Keep visualizations simple. When deciding what to include in a presentation, less is more.
### 5. Build positive professional relationships
When you consider the responsibilities and objectives of others, your communication will reflect that consideration. This builds credibility and influence in your workplace and allows you to continue growing throughout your career. 
-   Focus on what matters to your audience.
-   Invite feedback and discussion.
-   Be a trusted subject matter expert who communicates clearly and inclusively.
-   Cultivate positive interactions to strengthen working relationships and improve morale.

**Pro tip**: When you are contacted by a stakeholder, be accessible and engaged in your communication.

## Activity - Communicate with stakeholders in different roles
*You are a data analyst working for the National Parks Service*. One of the major concerns of this governmental agency is wildfires, which destroy an average of 7.4 million acres annually in the United States. The National Parks Service has created a data team to improve the predictability of wildfires. As a result, prevention efforts have been targeted more effectively and resources have been delegated to the appropriate areas.

*The agency set an internal goal for the wildfire predictive model of at least 90% accuracy*. The team’s final model consistently met this goal when running data from past years. As a direct result of the wildfire project, the prior prediction system was improved by 35% and helped wildfire prevention efforts globally. The results of this study are now referenced in numerous courses used to train firefighters, park rangers, and national park employees.

Your manager has asked you to email the following two new agency employees and give them an overview of the wildfire project:

-   A data analytics professional who will be working within your team. This person will need to know details about the data team’s workflow and relevant information required to maintain the accuracy of the wildfire project’s machine learning model. 
-   A writer for the agency’s public relations department. This person will need relevant information in order to create non-technical articles that promote the National Parks Service’s fire safety efforts.
