![[Pasted image 20230518173204.png]]
All data professionals share a love of data and a desire to solve problems. During their analytical work, they outline the story they want to tell, then test it from different angles with further investigation to verify its robustness before presenting it to decision makers. They rely on their programming and investigative skills to guide others towards informed decisions, combining practical knowledge with an awareness of what makes for effective communication and collaboration. Work in data analysis requires a mix of business sense and skills in collecting, manipulating and analysing data. Key interpersonal skills include communication, active listening and critical thinking. These professionals act as 'data investigators', looking for hidden information within large amounts of data and investigating connections between different sources. Very often, the process includes data cleansing, which consists of reorganising and reformatting the data to remove any element that could create an error during analysis. Subsequently, the data are ready to be analysed and are often visualised graphically to reveal further insights. Visualisation tools are very useful for identifying patterns and sharing information with others. Later, you will also learn about more advanced skills such as model building and machine learning algorithms. With the growing demand for data analysis in all kinds of companies, you are likely to find opportunities in an area of your own interest. In the near future, work in the field of data will be examined.

## Ideal qualities for data analytics professionals

### Being coachable
Coachable individuals are capable of receiving feedback and using that information to make improvements. At the center of being coachable is a positive attitude, and the ability to self-reflect and take steps to grow. People who are coachable usually have a growth mindset, which is a belief that hard work and determination can make them better. As a result, they view feedback from colleagues and supervisors as an opportunity to improve their skill set.

### Strong interpersonal skills
You may recall that data professionals and business intelligence professionals interact closely; together, they influence an organization's decision-making. Throughout a project, a data analyst will interact with many stakeholders, from different areas of an organization. Often, these interactions will extend to include clients, users, or representatives from other companies. Additionally, data professionals will work closely with a variety of other professionals as a member of a cross-functional team. Examples from job postings include interpersonal skill requirements for candidates and will include these types of statements:

-   We seek employees that can build relationships internally to transfer knowledge, consult with fellow data scientists and analysts to guide analysis, and deliver larger projects.
    
-   Wanting to hire those with the ability to negotiate complex and/or sensitive issues; and maintain good working relations.
    
-   Our data professionals value building strong relationships with colleagues and partners.
    

**Pro tip**: Include interpersonal skills on your list of qualifications on your resume. Revisit the material within this program (including the material on communication you will be introduced to later in this course). Find opportunities to add examples of teamwork, empathy, leadership, mediating, and active listening.

### Key takeaways
Employers in a variety of industries are eager to hire data professionals who possess more than just technical expertise. You can highlight your non-technical abilities for potential employers in several ways. Discover ways to successfully and effectively communicate your passions. By demonstrating a commitment to professional growth and sharing examples of your ability to solve problems, you can set yourself apart from other candidates.




# Work in the field

## What data professionals do
You can learn a lot about a career by looking at job postings. If you've searched for opportunities in the data space, you may have noticed different data-related job titles with similar responsibilities or postings with similar titles listing different responsibilities. Here's an example. At one company, the role of data analysts will focus on using statistics and models to craft insights that inform business decisions. Another job with the same title at a different company may focus on optimizing the tools and products that automate analytical processes. One reason for these inconsistencies is that data tasks and responsibilities are dependent on an organization's data, team structure, and how they make use of insights and analytics. As such, some organizations choose to be very specific with responsibilities. Others leave job tasks quite broad in scope. That's why this program refers to the field as a career space. With that said, when you're comparing positions that have similar titles, I encourage you to classify them based on the skills used in their day-to-day activities. Two of the most common titles are data analysts and data scientist. These can cover a wide range of job responsibilities, many of which you'll gain experience with in this program. Traditionally, a data scientist was expected to be a three in one expert in data analytics, statistics, and machine learning. But not all employers use these conventions when writing their job descriptions. Generally, any role that includes analytics expects candidates to be able to function as technically skilled social scientists, looking for patterns and identifying trends within big datasets. Also, they develop new inquiries and questions as they uncover the stories inside their data. Their hard work can help steer a company's future actions and guide decision making. They allow their organizations to keep a finger on the pulse of what's going on in the business. Interpreting and translating key information into visualizations such as graphs and charts, allowing every stakeholder to understand their findings. At times, they may be tasked with creating computer code and models to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions. When you investigate job postings, you'll encounter other titles with similar responsibilities. For example, junior data scientist, data scientist - entry level, associate data scientist, or data science associate. All of these roles include a mix of technical and strategic skills to help others make informed decisions. In your career, you might encounter other professionals in roles that use data and analytical skills. Some of these may overlap with the skills you will learn, but these roles are specific to certain tasks or our supervisory positions. Let's take a look at a few. Data scientists depend on systems within their companies to collect, organize, and convert raw data. Designing and maintaining these processes are some of the most important responsibilities of a data engineer. Their goal is to make data accessible so that it can be used for analysis. They also ensure that the company's data ecosystem is healthy and produces reliable results. These positions are highly technical and typically deal with the infrastructure for data, usually across an entire enterprise. You also need to have the ability to get data before it even make sense to talk about data analysis. Most of the technical work leading up to the birthing of the data may comfortably be called data engineering. Everything done once some data have arrived is data science. Similar to how a data engineer oversees the data infrastructure, there are data roles that manage all aspects of data analytics projects for a company. 
* *Insights managers* or analytics team managers often supervise the analytical strategy of the team or the organization as a whole. As a data analyst, you will likely report to someone working in this capacity. They're often responsible for managing multiple groups of customers and stakeholders and they're often a hybrid between the data scientist and the decision maker. Since this combination of skills is rare, these positions are often more difficult to fill. This role can have other titles like analytics team director, head of data, or data science director. You may encounter another job role in your scan of job postings. 
* *Business intelligence engineer*, or business analyst. This role is highly strategic, focused on organizing information and making it accessible. BI analysts synthesize data, build dashboards, and prepare reports to address specific needs for a business or requests from leadership. 

### Kinds of data professionals
[[Week 1#Data Professionals]] introduce data professionals but let's talk about what kind of pro exists:
1.  **Data Analyst**: Data analysts are professionals who interpret complex data to assist businesses in making decisions. They use statistical analysis techniques, predictive models, and other methods to analyze and interpret data collected by a company. The goal is to extract meaningful information and provide data-based recommendations. Data analysts must have a strong understanding of statistical techniques and data manipulation skills, as well as being able to effectively communicate findings to business decision-makers.
    
2.  **Data Scientist**: Data scientists perform a role similar to data analysts, but they tend to work with larger and more complex data and use more advanced techniques. A data scientist often works with machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques to create large-scale predictive models. These professionals must have advanced programming skills, a deep understanding of statistical methods and machine learning techniques, and the ability to formulate and answer complex questions with data.
    
3.  **Data Engineer**: Data engineers are responsible for creating and maintaining the data architectures that allow data analysts and data scientists to do their work. They create and manage database systems, handle data collection, storage, and retrieval, and implement systems to ensure data is accurate and accessible. A data engineer must have strong computer science skills, particularly in database design and management, and an understanding of the principles of data engineering.

## The Data career space
The data career space is relatively young but growing rapidly, offering many opportunities and job security. Traditionally, these roles were filled by individuals with backgrounds in computer engineering or statistics, but there's now a shift towards promoting analytical skills. When you start as a data professional, understanding how data tasks can vary and adapt to project needs is key. Early in your career, it's beneficial to take on a variety of tasks to develop a broad skill set. As part of a larger team, you'll have the chance to learn from others, and once the analytical process is completed, the results need to be shared across the organization, often requiring user-friendly interfaces and clear communication. Large companies often need teams of data professionals to handle the vast amounts of information they deal with. The roles and responsibilities within these data teams can be quite diverse, tailored to the complexity of the organization and the specific project requirements.

## Build the perfect data team
The data needs of larger companies requires the creation of a team of skilled professionals. The members of these teams each have a specialized area of expertise. Some will come from business backgrounds, some with project or staff management experience, while others will have more technical skills. While there is no checklist available for companies to follow when putting together their team of data professionals, the needs of their organization can help guide them.

Creating a team of data analytics professionals is very similar to how sports franchises put together championship-level rosters. Coaches and general managers are always looking to upgrade and enhance the capabilities of their teams. While having a superstar athlete can help deliver a consistent performance at a certain position, their abrupt departure can compromise the team’s overall performance. A better approach is to develop a well-balanced and collaborative team. 

Employers want to hire someone who has more than data analytic skills. They are selecting the best fit for their organization. Candidates who bring additional experience and skills beyond data analytics are most often seen as most favorable. Strong interpersonal and communication skills, experience working in business, or within a team dynamic can enhance data analytics. There is a very good chance that you already possess some of these skills.

### Five principles for data team building
After you join a data team, there are still challenges to building a data-driven organization. Below you will find five principles that can guide any organization to becoming more effective when facing the challenges of data analysis, regardless of the structure of your data teams within the company.

1. **Adaptability**: For effective data work, both the organization's platforms and the data professionals need to be flexible and adaptable. This includes allowing integration of various tools and being open to continual learning as technologies evolve.
2. **Activation**: Data literacy within an organization is essential. This can be fostered by promoting the use of data analysis through accessible interfaces and encouraging collaboration. Effective communication skills are crucial here.
3. **Standardization**: Standardizing data practices promotes best practices and ease of information transfer. This requires a culture of collaboration and the recruitment of innovative problem solvers.
4. **Accountability**: Transparency, explainability, and security are vital for data teams and projects. This involves maintaining a ‘paper trail’ and effectively communicating ideas and processes.
5. **Business Impact**: Organizations should consider a wide array of data analytical solutions in project planning to estimate their potential business impact. Building trust and demonstrating consistent results are key to broadening the organization's scope.
   
### Key takeaways
Organizations carefully consider the individuals they bring into their organization and seek candidates that embody qualities that go beyond data skills. Additionally, companies can influence their adaptability by hiring data professionals that embody the spirit of lifelong learning, effective communication, interpersonal skills, and the ability to solve problems.

## Organize data teams with a RACI matrix
RACI is an acronym that comes from four classifications of involvement: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. The RACI matrix is one of many ways that companies organize roles and responsibilities. It is a visual that helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently and lists who is "responsible," "accountable," "consulted," and "informed" for project tasks.

### An overview of the RACI matrix
When companies employ the RACI matrix, stakeholders and cross-functional team members have a clearer understanding of involvement throughout the entire project. Although you may encounter other structural models, the RACI matrix offers you a lot of information on workplace responsibilities in a simple way. The matrix identifies and assigns project tasks to one of the following levels of engagement:

-   **Responsible**: The cross-functional team members in this role are directly responsible for performing the work necessary or make decisions that are directly related to completing a task within a project. There can be several roles or groups responsible for this task, meaning that the responsibilities are held jointly by more than one classification.
    
-   **Accountable**: Those assigned the accountable role within a task are given the job of approving the work performed by those ‘responsible’. As a general rule there is usually a single person in this role, often a manager, or project lead.
    
-   **Consulted**: This role applies to those assigned to offer input on a task. There should be a clear and open line of two-way communication between those assigned to ‘responsible’ and ‘consulted’. There can be several people in this role. In many situations, they are referred to as subject matter experts or SMEs for short.
    
-   **Informed**: Those in this role need to be kept aware of progress and concerns of those working on a project. These responsibilities tend to be assigned to higher levels of senior leadership. They need to understand the insights from projects rather than the details of how specific tasks are performed. 
    

By labeling someone to one of these four categories, the RACI matrix helps categorize their level of involvement and proximity to each task. When you know who is involved, and at what level, it’s easier to determine who to contact if any concerns arise.

### Task example in a RACI matrix

One of the tasks essential to any analytics project is providing access to data. This means that when you assume this role, you will help others use the available data. The RACI matrix is a way to communicate the level of accountability for this task by assigning cross-functional team members to one of the four categories: **R: Responsible, A: Accountable, C: Consulted,** or **I: Informed**
|**Task**|**BI Eng.**|**Data Scientist**|**Analytics Team Manager**|**Data Engineer**|**Chief Data Officer**|
|:---:|:-------:|:-------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
|Access to Data|R|C|R|R|A|
|Create models to analyze data|C|R|C|I|A|
|Drive insights and reccomendations based on data|C|R|C|I|A|
|Ensure data compliance|C|I|C|R|A|


On the sample RACI chart above, three of the data roles have been marked as ‘responsible’ for facilitating data accessibility. 

-   BI engineers organize existing data and provide reports to help understand what type of data is available.
    
-   Analytics team managers develop and prioritize work streams based on business questions that can be addressed with the data.
    
-   Data engineers build custom pipelines to manage organization of and access to the raw data the team needs. 
    

All three of these roles have been assigned tasks that will provide ‘access to data’ for other team members. 

Notice that data scientists are "consulted" in this example. Although they are instrumental in analyzing data and providing insights, they might not take the lead in initially acquiring the data. However, they'll want to work closely with those leading the process to make sure they have data that is aligned to the business objectives and modeling approach. 

To explore how all four classifications of interactivity function within the RACI matrix, an additional executive-level role is included. 
**Chief Data Officer**: in charge of consistency, accuracy, relevancy, interpretability, and reliability of the data a team provides.
There will be some tasks that will require more senior stakeholder engagement. One of those tasks being to ensure that data used in analysis is compliant with industry standards and regulations.
**Ensure Data Compliance:** Team members responsible for making sure that the organization follows protocols and legal requirements of data stewardship.

### The Benefits of the RACI Matrix

-   Allows easier workload analysis for teams and individuals
    
-   Helps ensure that critical processes are not overlooked
    
-   Allows new team members to quickly identify roles and responsibilities
    
-   Streamlines project and task management
    
-   Enables cross-team communication
    
-   Centralizes documentation for the roles and responsibilities within a project or organization

### Key takeaways

In your work as a data professional, you might encounter the RACI matrix. It is a tool that many organizations use to structure their projects. It also helps to outline, communicate, and understand the responsibilities of data analytics professionals and other cross-functional team members.
