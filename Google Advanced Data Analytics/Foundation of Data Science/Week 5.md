# Building a portfolio ti impress
## The value of a portfolio
Experiential learning, or understanding through doing, is a key concept that involves immersing oneself in situations to practice and further develop skills. In the context of data analysis, experiential learning allows you to understand how data analysis is used in various industries and helps build self-confidence. This practice will be put to use in a portfolio project. A portfolio is a collection of materials that showcase one's abilities and can be shared with potential employers.

The portfolio project for this course involves using the PACE model to set up tasks. This will give you hands-on experience and will be particularly useful as companies often ask for such projects during the interview process to assess how a candidate approaches common business challenges.

Transferable skills, skills that can be used in various job roles or industries, will also be highlighted in this process. Examples include problem-solving, meeting deadlines, and organizational skills. These can be included in a PACE strategy document and reflected upon for their potential application in the data analysis field.

By the end of this process, you'll have a comprehensive set of artifacts for your portfolio, demonstrating your expertise across various tools and scenarios in the data career space.

## Introduction to your Course 1 end-of-course portfolio project
In job interviews at Google, portfolios are appreciated as they demonstrate a candidate's knowledge and capabilities in a clear format. They can set you apart from other candidates by showcasing your ability to understand business scenarios, communicate effectively, and use tools to solve complex problems. Thus far, you've learned about the role of data professionals, career paths, core analysis practices, and tools.

Your next step will be to apply this knowledge to a portfolio project. This involves understanding an organization, its stakeholders, and the business problem to be solved. You'll use the PACE model (Plan, Audience, Context, Execution) to create a strategy document outlining the project details and steps.

As you progress through the course, you'll continue to use the PACE model for your portfolio projects, refining your data analytics workflow. By the end, you'll have a comprehensive portfolio that showcases your skills and thought processes, making it an excellent talking point during interviews. It's now time to apply this knowledge and help organizations navigate through the world of data.

## End-of-course portfolio project introduction
Each course in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate concludes with a project that provides hands-on opportunities to practice your knowledge. These end-of-course portfolio projects build across courses to simulate the full lifecycle of a data project, just like job tasks that you will encounter as a data professional. 

After completing all of the courses in this certificate program, you are encouraged to compile the projects in a portfolio that highlights your data analytics skills. You will learn how to create a portfolio in the final course of this certificate program: [[Google Advance Data Analytics Capstone]]. In addition, the end-of-course projects can also be used to help you prepare for job applications and interviews since they showcase the valuable skills that you bring to the world of data analytics.

### Importance of communication in the data career space
End-of-course projects emphasize technical and professional workplace skills, as well as the importance of communication in data analytics. The success of your workflow management, data analysis, data visualizations, statistics, regression analysis, and building machine learning models relies on your ability to communicate with cross-functional team members. So, each project is designed to help you develop critical communication skills that you’ll need to use on the job in order to effectively: 
- Ask questions
- Share project needs
- Communicate with stakeholders
- Give and receive feedback
- Stay in contact with team members on the project

#### Expectations
As previously mentioned, you will encounter an end-of-course project in the final week of each course. The end-of-course projects were designed around a workplace scenario that will guide you through tasks that align with the concepts and skills you learned in each course. The workplace scenario extends across all of the certificate’s end-of-course projects.

You will be given the tools, resources, and instructions needed to apply your new skills and complete each individual end-of-course project.  Additionally, you’ll also have access to helpful resources designed to guide and inspire your data analysis workflow. In the end, your effort will be rewarded with work examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of your data analysis. If you get stuck at any point, there are links to review relevant information within each course.

To help you complete each end-of-course project, you will receive a PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute) strategy document to guide your workflow. As you answer the questions, you will gain a deeper understanding of the data analysis process, document your growth as a data professional, and prepare the observations and reflections needed to complete each project.

# Automatidata scenario
**Learn about the Course 1 Automatidata workplace scenario!**
The end-of-course project in Course 1 focuses on your ability to plan for data projects and create a project proposal. The end-of-course projects were designed with you in mind, offering an opportunity for you to practice and apply your data analytic skills. The materials provided here will guide you through discussions with co-workers, internal team members, and external stakeholders.

### Background on the Automatidata scenario
Congrats on your new job as a data analyst at a data consulting firm called Automatidata. Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. ***The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that predicts taxi and limousine ride durations based on location and time of day data that TLC has gathered***. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

**Note:** _This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior._

#### Project background

Automatidata is in the earliest stages of the TLC project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

- A project proposal identifying the following:
    
    - Organize project tasks into milestones
        
    - Classify tasks using the PACE workflow
        
    - Identify relevant stakeholders
        

#### Your assignment

For your first assignment, Automatidata will need a project proposal that will create milestones for the tasks within the TLC project. Remember to take into account your audience, team, project goal, and PACE stages of each task in planning your project deliverable.

**From:** Deshawn Washington

**Subject:** Review meeting notes

If you are able to read this, then your company accounts have been created! Now is the perfect time to get started. Last week, I attended an internal meeting with our leadership team about a new project we are about to begin. You’ll receive more information in the next few days, but I would like you to be aware of some needs that were identified by our leadership team. Here is an excerpt from the notes I took during the Automatidata leadership team meeting. I’ve organized the points by the person who made them.

**Uli King  (Senior Project Manager)**

- The data team will need a global-level project document to outline the goals and milestones.
    
- I am working closely with Titus Nelson over at the New York City Taxi and Limo Commission. He has requested some visuals to share with TLC’s executives.
    

**Luana Rodriquez (Senior Data Analyst)**

- The dataset from TLC has to be inspected before any analysis can begin. 
    
- Our team needs to determine what information the TLC data provides through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    
- Eventually, our team will need to test to find if the model is delivering consistent results.
    

**Udo Bankole (Director of Data Analysis)**

- Before we present any insights to TLC, we'll need to determine whether or not the model we produce meets the project requirements.
    
- Once we have a final model, I'll need to know the main talking points going into our presentation with TLC.
    

**My thoughts and concerns…**

- I think it's best to use Python for the TLC project. I'll have someone on my team set that up as soon as we have the plan in place.
    
- It will be important to establish the relationship between any variables within the TLC data. I'd suggest the data team consider A/B testing.
    

Review the meeting notes above to become familiar with the project’s context. I’ll ask you to identify project tasks and come up with a structure to guide the data team through this project. After our discussion about your experience in the certificate program offered by Google, I know that your efficient communication style and problem-solving will enhance the abilities of the data team. 

There will be more details sent to you very soon.

Welcome to the team,

Deshawn Washington
