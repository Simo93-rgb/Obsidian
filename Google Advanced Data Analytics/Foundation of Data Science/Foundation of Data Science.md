# Data
I dati sono qualunque cosa prodotta da dispositivi elettronici. Questi sono una fonte inestimabile (si fa per dire, in realtà si stima molto bene) di informazione che può essere utilizzata per migliorare qualsiasi situazione esistente: processi industriali, modelli di business, profilazione dei clienti, risoluzione problemi... 
**Data Science** è la disciplina che usa dati grezzi per creare nuovi modi di modellare e capire l'ignoto.
## Data Professionals
Il professionista si avvale di alcuni strumenti per poter lavorare:
	Statistica
	Metodo scientifico
	Analisi dei dati
	Intelligienza Artificiale
**Data Science** è la disciplina che rende i dati utili. I metodi e i criteri di valutazione dei dati sono definite **metriche**.
I dati sono i tassello necessario per prendere decisioni.
#### Considerazioni Storiche
Collezionare, preservare, analizzare dati sono operazioni vecchie come l'essere umano stesso. Bisogna considerare che ogni era ha le sue tecnologie e questo comporta una diversa gestione a seconda degli strumenti a disposizione; presumo sua ovvio che avere centinaia di migliaia di schede perforate sia molto diverso che avere una scheda SD. 
#### Data Toolbox
I linguaggi di programmazione sono i primi strumenti da tenere nel proprio set di tools, in particolare *R* e *Python*. 
**Tableau** è un visual data tool importante che consente di condividere i dati attraverso un'interfaccia grafica. È importantissimo per avere la giusta comunicazione con gli stakeholders non tecnici. 
Lo **storyteller** è la figura che comunica e fondamentalmente sei tu con le tue abilità linguistiche.

L'analisi predittiva può individuare i punti deboli di reti e sistemi e aiutare a difendersi dalle tattiche avversarie. Questo aiuta a sviluppare metodi per rilevare le violazioni dei dati attraverso la logica, i modelli e gli strumenti di dati. L'intelligenza artificiale (AI) viene sfruttata per migliorare la capacità di identificare gli attacchi e di rispondere ad essi.



# Important ethical considerations for data professionals
Una delle responsabilità più importanti per chi lavora in carriere basate sui dati riguarda la **protezione** e la **gestione** dei dati all'interno delle proprie organizzazioni. Quasi tutte le comunicazioni generano dati, dai ricevute di acquisto alla conferma di un ordine, fino ai punti fedeltà dei clienti. Le aziende hanno un grande dovere nei confronti dei loro clienti, specialmente quando si tratta di mantenere e proteggere la privacy degli utenti. I dati raccolti dagli individui sono definiti **informazioni personali identificabili (PII - personally identifiable information)**, che permettono di identificare un individuo direttamente o indirettamente. Poiché queste informazioni sono spesso associate a record medici, finanziari e lavorativi, sono sensibili e devono essere gestite con cura. Di recente, si stanno facendo grandi sforzi per proteggere gli individui, tendendo verso l'aggregazione dei dati, ovvero dati provenienti da un gran numero di utenti che hanno eliminato le informazioni personali. Questo protegge le persone e dà loro più controllo sui propri dati. Tuttavia, bisogna tenere a mente che la raccolta dei dati è un compito gestito da esseri umani, il che può essere influenzato da diversi background, esperienze, credenze e visioni del mondo. Questi e altri tipi di pregiudizi possono influenzare il modo in cui i dati vengono comunicati e come vengono condivisi i risultati, influenzando a loro volta le decisioni aziendali. Pertanto, è importante essere molto attenti nell'interpretare i dati dove c'è una chiara fonte di pregiudizio e cercare di identificare anche i pregiudizi più sottili. Infine, un buon campione di dati deve essere rappresentativo dell'intera popolazione di interesse.
# Critical data security and privacy principles

Accenntato precedentemente, la gestione dei dati comporta una certa etica e professionalità soprattutto per le PII. 

## Privacy Matters
La privacy dei dati significa preservare le informazioni e l'attività di una persona interessata ogni volta che si verifica una transazione di dati. È anche chiamata privacy delle informazioni o protezione dei dati. La privacy dei dati riguarda l'accesso, l'uso e la raccolta dei dati personali. Per le persone i cui dati vengono raccolti, ciò significa che hanno il diritto di:    
* protezione dall'accesso non autorizzato ai propri dati personali    
* Libertà dall'uso inappropriato dei loro dati    
* Il diritto di consultare, aggiornare o correggere i propri dati.    
* Possibilità di dare il consenso alla raccolta dei dati    
* Diritto legale di accesso ai dati    
Per mantenere questi diritti, le aziende e le organizzazioni devono adottare misure di privacy per proteggere i dati delle persone. È anche una questione di fiducia. La capacità del pubblico di affidare alle aziende i dati personali è importante. È ciò che spinge le persone a utilizzare i prodotti di un'azienda, a condividere le proprie informazioni e altro ancora.

## Protecting Privacy with data anonymization

![[Pasted image 20230517172328.png]]

Normalmente il minimo indispensabile è fare in modo che solo personale autorizzato possa accedere a dati PII ma potrebbe non bastare. Si ricorre ad una tecnica precisa per alzare il livello di protezione, la tecnica di **anonimizzazione**.
L'anonimizzazione dei dati è il processo di protezione dei dati privati o sensibili delle persone attraverso l'eliminazione delle PII. In genere, l'anonimizzazione dei dati comporta la cancellazione, l'hashing o il mascheramento delle informazioni personali, spesso utilizzando codici a lunghezza fissa per rappresentare le colonne di dati o nascondendo i dati con valori alterati.
Anche il concetto di aggregazione, visto in Business Intelligence, comporta intrinsecamente uno strato di protezione del singolo perché i dati vengono sommati (aggregati) a quelli di altri utenti.

## key takeaways
Per tutti i professionisti che lavorano con dati relativi a persone reali, è importante considerare la sicurezza e la privacy di queste persone. Ecco perché è importante capire l'importanza della privacy dei dati e come rendere sicuri i dati che contengono PII per l'analisi. Abbiamo la responsabilità di proteggere i dati delle persone e le informazioni personali che potrebbero contenere.

# The practices and principles of good data stewardship
Tutti i professionisti dei dati hanno la responsabilità di garantire la qualità, l'integrità, l'accessibilità e la sicurezza dei dati. La gestione dei dati è la pratica di garantire che i dati siano accessibili, utilizzabili e sicuri. La gestione dei dati è una parte normale delle abitudini lavorative di un professionista del settore, a beneficio di tutti coloro che si affidano alle analisi, sia all'interno che all'esterno dell'organizzazione. 

## Rispetto della Privacy
Come professionista dell'analisi dei dati, è importante essere attenti a qualsiasi dato personale e proteggerlo con cura. È responsabilità di tutti coloro che hanno accesso ai dati all'interno dell'organizzazione proteggere la privacy dei loro utenti.

## Non causare danni involontari
Molti dei risultati dell'analisi dei dati hanno il potenziale per influenzare le persone attraverso una vasta gamma di fattori sociali ed economici. È buona pratica produrre informazioni accurate rispettando le norme culturali e sociali.

## Evitare di creare o rafforzare pregiudizi
Identificare i pregiudizi non è sempre semplice. Quando lavori con i dati, tieni presente che la raccolta dei dati è un compito gestito da esseri umani, il che può essere influenzato da diversi background, esperienze, credenze e visioni del mondo.

## Considerare l'inclusività
Come professionista dell'analisi dei dati, dovrai considerare se i metodi di raccolta dei dati hanno escluso informazioni da particolari popolazioni. Gli approcci inclusivi possono ampliare il modo in cui qualsiasi organizzazione raccoglie e analizza i dati.

## Mantenere elevati standard scientifici
I processi e le tecnologie con cui interagirai come professionista dell'analisi dei dati sono profondamente radicati nel metodo scientifico. Invita il feedback e valuta il feedback. Ricorda, l'intelligenza artificiale dipende ancora fortemente dalle istruzioni fornite dai professionisti dei dati.

## Conclusioni principali
La gestione dei dati è la responsabilità di ogni professionista dei dati. Guida i tuoi sforzi attraverso principi scientifici ed etici e rimani consapevole dei possibili pregiudizi durante tutto il processo di analisi dei dati.

## Key Takeaways
La gestione dei dati è una responsabilità di ogni professionista dei dati. Questa responsabilità va oltre le interazioni con i dati. Conducendo il vostro lavoro in modo socialmente vantaggioso e inclusivo, aumenterete la vostra capacità di identificare i pregiudizi umani. Guidate i vostri sforzi attraverso principi scientifici ed etici e rimanete consapevoli dei possibili pregiudizi durante il processo di analisi dei dati.

# Data career skills
## The top skills needed for a data career
![[Pasted image 20230518173204.png]]
All data professionals share a love of data and a desire to solve problems. During their analytical work, they outline the story they want to tell, then test it from different angles with further investigation to verify its robustness before presenting it to decision makers. They rely on their programming and investigative skills to guide others towards informed decisions, combining practical knowledge with an awareness of what makes for effective communication and collaboration. Work in data analysis requires a mix of business sense and skills in collecting, manipulating and analysing data. Key interpersonal skills include communication, active listening and critical thinking. These professionals act as 'data investigators', looking for hidden information within large amounts of data and investigating connections between different sources. Very often, the process includes data cleansing, which consists of reorganising and reformatting the data to remove any element that could create an error during analysis. Subsequently, the data are ready to be analysed and are often visualised graphically to reveal further insights. Visualisation tools are very useful for identifying patterns and sharing information with others. Later, you will also learn about more advanced skills such as model building and machine learning algorithms. With the growing demand for data analysis in all kinds of companies, you are likely to find opportunities in an area of your own interest. In the near future, work in the field of data will be examined.

## Ideal qualities for data analytics professionals

### Being coachable
Coachable individuals are capable of receiving feedback and using that information to make improvements. At the center of being coachable is a positive attitude, and the ability to self-reflect and take steps to grow. People who are coachable usually have a growth mindset, which is a belief that hard work and determination can make them better. As a result, they view feedback from colleagues and supervisors as an opportunity to improve their skill set.

### Strong interpersonal skills
You may recall that data professionals and business intelligence professionals interact closely; together, they influence an organization's decision-making. Throughout a project, a data analyst will interact with many stakeholders, from different areas of an organization. Often, these interactions will extend to include clients, users, or representatives from other companies. Additionally, data professionals will work closely with a variety of other professionals as a member of a cross-functional team. Examples from job postings include interpersonal skill requirements for candidates and will include these types of statements:

-   We seek employees that can build relationships internally to transfer knowledge, consult with fellow data scientists and analysts to guide analysis, and deliver larger projects.
    
-   Wanting to hire those with the ability to negotiate complex and/or sensitive issues; and maintain good working relations.
    
-   Our data professionals value building strong relationships with colleagues and partners.
    

**Pro tip**: Include interpersonal skills on your list of qualifications on your resume. Revisit the material within this program (including the material on communication you will be introduced to later in this course). Find opportunities to add examples of teamwork, empathy, leadership, mediating, and active listening.

### Key takeaways
Employers in a variety of industries are eager to hire data professionals who possess more than just technical expertise. You can highlight your non-technical abilities for potential employers in several ways. Discover ways to successfully and effectively communicate your passions. By demonstrating a commitment to professional growth and sharing examples of your ability to solve problems, you can set yourself apart from other candidates.




# Work in the field

## What data professionals do
You can learn a lot about a career by looking at job postings. If you've searched for opportunities in the data space, you may have noticed different data-related job titles with similar responsibilities or postings with similar titles listing different responsibilities. Here's an example. At one company, the role of data analysts will focus on using statistics and models to craft insights that inform business decisions. Another job with the same title at a different company may focus on optimizing the tools and products that automate analytical processes. One reason for these inconsistencies is that data tasks and responsibilities are dependent on an organization's data, team structure, and how they make use of insights and analytics. As such, some organizations choose to be very specific with responsibilities. Others leave job tasks quite broad in scope. That's why this program refers to the field as a career space. With that said, when you're comparing positions that have similar titles, I encourage you to classify them based on the skills used in their day-to-day activities. Two of the most common titles are data analysts and data scientist. These can cover a wide range of job responsibilities, many of which you'll gain experience with in this program. Traditionally, a data scientist was expected to be a three in one expert in data analytics, statistics, and machine learning. But not all employers use these conventions when writing their job descriptions. Generally, any role that includes analytics expects candidates to be able to function as technically skilled social scientists, looking for patterns and identifying trends within big datasets. Also, they develop new inquiries and questions as they uncover the stories inside their data. Their hard work can help steer a company's future actions and guide decision making. They allow their organizations to keep a finger on the pulse of what's going on in the business. Interpreting and translating key information into visualizations such as graphs and charts, allowing every stakeholder to understand their findings. At times, they may be tasked with creating computer code and models to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions. When you investigate job postings, you'll encounter other titles with similar responsibilities. For example, junior data scientist, data scientist - entry level, associate data scientist, or data science associate. All of these roles include a mix of technical and strategic skills to help others make informed decisions. In your career, you might encounter other professionals in roles that use data and analytical skills. Some of these may overlap with the skills you will learn, but these roles are specific to certain tasks or our supervisory positions. Let's take a look at a few. Data scientists depend on systems within their companies to collect, organize, and convert raw data. Designing and maintaining these processes are some of the most important responsibilities of a data engineer. Their goal is to make data accessible so that it can be used for analysis. They also ensure that the company's data ecosystem is healthy and produces reliable results. These positions are highly technical and typically deal with the infrastructure for data, usually across an entire enterprise. You also need to have the ability to get data before it even make sense to talk about data analysis. Most of the technical work leading up to the birthing of the data may comfortably be called data engineering. Everything done once some data have arrived is data science. Similar to how a data engineer oversees the data infrastructure, there are data roles that manage all aspects of data analytics projects for a company. 
* *Insights managers* or analytics team managers often supervise the analytical strategy of the team or the organization as a whole. As a data analyst, you will likely report to someone working in this capacity. They're often responsible for managing multiple groups of customers and stakeholders and they're often a hybrid between the data scientist and the decision maker. Since this combination of skills is rare, these positions are often more difficult to fill. This role can have other titles like analytics team director, head of data, or data science director. You may encounter another job role in your scan of job postings. 
* *Business intelligence engineer*, or business analyst. This role is highly strategic, focused on organizing information and making it accessible. BI analysts synthesize data, build dashboards, and prepare reports to address specific needs for a business or requests from leadership. 

### Kinds of data professionals
[[#Data Professionals]] introduce data professionals but let's talk about what kind of pro exists:
1.  **Data Analyst**: Data analysts are professionals who interpret complex data to assist businesses in making decisions. They use statistical analysis techniques, predictive models, and other methods to analyze and interpret data collected by a company. The goal is to extract meaningful information and provide data-based recommendations. Data analysts must have a strong understanding of statistical techniques and data manipulation skills, as well as being able to effectively communicate findings to business decision-makers.
    
2.  **Data Scientist**: Data scientists perform a role similar to data analysts, but they tend to work with larger and more complex data and use more advanced techniques. A data scientist often works with machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques to create large-scale predictive models. These professionals must have advanced programming skills, a deep understanding of statistical methods and machine learning techniques, and the ability to formulate and answer complex questions with data.
    
3.  **Data Engineer**: Data engineers are responsible for creating and maintaining the data architectures that allow data analysts and data scientists to do their work. They create and manage database systems, handle data collection, storage, and retrieval, and implement systems to ensure data is accurate and accessible. A data engineer must have strong computer science skills, particularly in database design and management, and an understanding of the principles of data engineering.

## The Data career space
The data career space is relatively young but growing rapidly, offering many opportunities and job security. Traditionally, these roles were filled by individuals with backgrounds in computer engineering or statistics, but there's now a shift towards promoting analytical skills. When you start as a data professional, understanding how data tasks can vary and adapt to project needs is key. Early in your career, it's beneficial to take on a variety of tasks to develop a broad skill set. As part of a larger team, you'll have the chance to learn from others, and once the analytical process is completed, the results need to be shared across the organization, often requiring user-friendly interfaces and clear communication. Large companies often need teams of data professionals to handle the vast amounts of information they deal with. The roles and responsibilities within these data teams can be quite diverse, tailored to the complexity of the organization and the specific project requirements.

## Build the perfect data team
The data needs of larger companies requires the creation of a team of skilled professionals. The members of these teams each have a specialized area of expertise. Some will come from business backgrounds, some with project or staff management experience, while others will have more technical skills. While there is no checklist available for companies to follow when putting together their team of data professionals, the needs of their organization can help guide them.

Creating a team of data analytics professionals is very similar to how sports franchises put together championship-level rosters. Coaches and general managers are always looking to upgrade and enhance the capabilities of their teams. While having a superstar athlete can help deliver a consistent performance at a certain position, their abrupt departure can compromise the team’s overall performance. A better approach is to develop a well-balanced and collaborative team. 

Employers want to hire someone who has more than data analytic skills. They are selecting the best fit for their organization. Candidates who bring additional experience and skills beyond data analytics are most often seen as most favorable. Strong interpersonal and communication skills, experience working in business, or within a team dynamic can enhance data analytics. There is a very good chance that you already possess some of these skills.

### Five principles for data team building
After you join a data team, there are still challenges to building a data-driven organization. Below you will find five principles that can guide any organization to becoming more effective when facing the challenges of data analysis, regardless of the structure of your data teams within the company.

1. **Adaptability**: For effective data work, both the organization's platforms and the data professionals need to be flexible and adaptable. This includes allowing integration of various tools and being open to continual learning as technologies evolve.
2. **Activation**: Data literacy within an organization is essential. This can be fostered by promoting the use of data analysis through accessible interfaces and encouraging collaboration. Effective communication skills are crucial here.
3. **Standardization**: Standardizing data practices promotes best practices and ease of information transfer. This requires a culture of collaboration and the recruitment of innovative problem solvers.
4. **Accountability**: Transparency, explainability, and security are vital for data teams and projects. This involves maintaining a ‘paper trail’ and effectively communicating ideas and processes.
5. **Business Impact**: Organizations should consider a wide array of data analytical solutions in project planning to estimate their potential business impact. Building trust and demonstrating consistent results are key to broadening the organization's scope.
   
### Key takeaways
Organizations carefully consider the individuals they bring into their organization and seek candidates that embody qualities that go beyond data skills. Additionally, companies can influence their adaptability by hiring data professionals that embody the spirit of lifelong learning, effective communication, interpersonal skills, and the ability to solve problems.

## Organize data teams with a RACI matrix
RACI is an acronym that comes from four classifications of involvement: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. The RACI matrix is one of many ways that companies organize roles and responsibilities. It is a visual that helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently and lists who is "responsible," "accountable," "consulted," and "informed" for project tasks.

### An overview of the RACI matrix
When companies employ the RACI matrix, stakeholders and cross-functional team members have a clearer understanding of involvement throughout the entire project. Although you may encounter other structural models, the RACI matrix offers you a lot of information on workplace responsibilities in a simple way. The matrix identifies and assigns project tasks to one of the following levels of engagement:

-   **Responsible**: The cross-functional team members in this role are directly responsible for performing the work necessary or make decisions that are directly related to completing a task within a project. There can be several roles or groups responsible for this task, meaning that the responsibilities are held jointly by more than one classification.
    
-   **Accountable**: Those assigned the accountable role within a task are given the job of approving the work performed by those ‘responsible’. As a general rule there is usually a single person in this role, often a manager, or project lead.
    
-   **Consulted**: This role applies to those assigned to offer input on a task. There should be a clear and open line of two-way communication between those assigned to ‘responsible’ and ‘consulted’. There can be several people in this role. In many situations, they are referred to as subject matter experts or SMEs for short.
    
-   **Informed**: Those in this role need to be kept aware of progress and concerns of those working on a project. These responsibilities tend to be assigned to higher levels of senior leadership. They need to understand the insights from projects rather than the details of how specific tasks are performed. 
    

By labeling someone to one of these four categories, the RACI matrix helps categorize their level of involvement and proximity to each task. When you know who is involved, and at what level, it’s easier to determine who to contact if any concerns arise.

### Task example in a RACI matrix

One of the tasks essential to any analytics project is providing access to data. This means that when you assume this role, you will help others use the available data. The RACI matrix is a way to communicate the level of accountability for this task by assigning cross-functional team members to one of the four categories: **R: Responsible, A: Accountable, C: Consulted,** or **I: Informed**
|**Task**|**BI Eng.**|**Data Scientist**|**Analytics Team Manager**|**Data Engineer**|**Chief Data Officer**|
|:---:|:-------:|:-------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
|Access to Data|R|C|R|R|A|
|Create models to analyze data|C|R|C|I|A|
|Drive insights and reccomendations based on data|C|R|C|I|A|
|Ensure data compliance|C|I|C|R|A|


On the sample RACI chart above, three of the data roles have been marked as ‘responsible’ for facilitating data accessibility. 

-   BI engineers organize existing data and provide reports to help understand what type of data is available.
    
-   Analytics team managers develop and prioritize work streams based on business questions that can be addressed with the data.
    
-   Data engineers build custom pipelines to manage organization of and access to the raw data the team needs. 
    

All three of these roles have been assigned tasks that will provide ‘access to data’ for other team members. 

Notice that data scientists are "consulted" in this example. Although they are instrumental in analyzing data and providing insights, they might not take the lead in initially acquiring the data. However, they'll want to work closely with those leading the process to make sure they have data that is aligned to the business objectives and modeling approach. 

To explore how all four classifications of interactivity function within the RACI matrix, an additional executive-level role is included. 
**Chief Data Officer**: in charge of consistency, accuracy, relevancy, interpretability, and reliability of the data a team provides.
There will be some tasks that will require more senior stakeholder engagement. One of those tasks being to ensure that data used in analysis is compliant with industry standards and regulations.
**Ensure Data Compliance:** Team members responsible for making sure that the organization follows protocols and legal requirements of data stewardship.

### The Benefits of the RACI Matrix

-   Allows easier workload analysis for teams and individuals
    
-   Helps ensure that critical processes are not overlooked
    
-   Allows new team members to quickly identify roles and responsibilities
    
-   Streamlines project and task management
    
-   Enables cross-team communication
    
-   Centralizes documentation for the roles and responsibilities within a project or organization

### Key takeaways
In your work as a data professional, you might encounter the RACI matrix. It is a tool that many organizations use to structure their projects. It also helps to outline, communicate, and understand the responsibilities of data analytics professionals and other cross-functional team members.

# The data project workflow
## Welcome to Week 4
We began our journey into the data professional world by covering the basics of data science, exploring careers, and discussing skills needed to succeed. In this section, we'll investigate the workflow within data-driven careers. You'll be introduced to a helpful organizational tool called the ***PACE*** model, that can provide structure while allowing great flexibility when working on projects. We'll explore the elements of effective communication and some best practices when sharing your ideas with others. All of these skills and tools will help you prepare for your upcoming portfolio project. I know you're excited to continue. Let's get started.

## Introduction to PACE
**Preparation is the key!**
![[Pasted image 20230522153328.png]]
Pace framework means:
- **Plan**: Define de scope of the project, involves defining project goals, strategies, and potential impacts.
- **Analyze**: Engage with the data, includes acquiring, cleaning, and transforming data, and conducting an exploratory data analysis.
- **Construct**: collaborate with other data professionals to build models and uncover data relationships.
- **Execute**: involves presenting findings, answering questions, and incorporating feedback.

This process isn't strictly linear, and revisits to previous stages may be needed based on new information. Communication is key throughout the process, likened to the flow of electricity in a circuit. The PACE framework's adaptability prepares professionals for a dynamic field requiring flexibility and effective communication. Through using the PACE framework, one can continually hone their skills and develop a personal workflow.
Let's digging into it.

### PLAN
At the beginning of a project, it is important to establish a solid foundation for success. Here you will define the scope of your project. This is when you will begin by identifying the informational needs of the organization. During the planning stage, you will have the widest viewpoint of a project. By assessing all of the factors and processes involved, you are mapping a path to completion, using your creativity to conceptualize a course of action. Here you will also take special note of tasks that may require an innovative approach within your workflow.

**Summary**: The planning stage is where you conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide you through the process of completing a project.

Here are a few examples of the types of planning stage tasks:

-   Research business data
    
-   Define the project scope
    
-   Develop a workflow
    
-   Assess project and/or stakeholder needs

### Analyze
In the analyzing stage, you will interact with the data for the first time. Here you will acquire all of the data you will need for the project. Some datasets could come from primary sources within your organization. Others may need to be collected from secondary sources outside your company. You may even find that you need governmental or open source data. The analyzing stage is also where you will engage in exploratory data analysis or EDA. This involves cleaning, reorganizing and analyzing all of the necessary data for the project.

**Summary**: The analyzing stage is where you will collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project.

Here are a few examples of the types of analyzing stage tasks:

-   Format database
    
-   Scrub data
    
-   Convert data into usable formats

### Construct
Just as the name suggests, the construction stage is all about building. In this stage of PACE, you will be building, interpreting, and revising models. Some projects will require machine learning algorithms to uncover correlations within your data. You will use these correlations to uncover information from the data that would otherwise go unused. These relationships can help your organization make informed decisions about the future.

**Summary**: In the construction stage you will build models that will allow you access to hidden relationships locked within data.

Here are a few examples of the types of construction stage tasks:

-   Select modeling approach
    
-   Build models
    
-   Build machine learning algorithms

### Execute
In the execution stage, you will put your analysis and construction into action. Here you will deliver your findings to the internal (inside of your organization) and external (outside of your organization) stakeholders. Quite often, this will involve stakeholders from the business-side of the companies you are working with. Presenting your findings is only a part of the execution stage. Stakeholders will provide feedback, ask questions, and make recommendations that you will collect and incorporate.

**Summary**: In the execution stage you will present the finding of your analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.

Here are a few examples of execution stage tasks:

-   Share results
    
-   Present findings to other stakeholders
    
-   Address feedback

### Overall Examples

# Elements of Communication
## Key elements of communication
![[Pasted image 20230522162052.png]]
Effective communication is pivotal in a data professional's role. In every communicative exchange, there are three key elements: purpose, receiver, and sender.

1. **Purpose**: This is the reason for communication. In data-focused settings, the purpose could be technical, requiring analysis or reporting, or strategic, guiding a company's financial or organizational efforts.
2. **Receiver**: This is the audience for the message. When crafting communication, it's helpful to consider what the audience already knows and what they need to know. Remember that every exchange can initiate a chain of events, especially as data professionals often work as part of a distributed team across an organization.
3. **Sender**: This is the person crafting the message. As the sender, you should consider your relationship to the receiver, your role in the exchange (are you reporting insights, pitching ideas, identifying potential data inputs), and any personal biases that might affect your message.

The interplay between these three elements impacts the message you intend to share. The same message may need to be presented in different ways depending on the purpose and the receiver. For instance, a data professional may explain a project differently to non-technical audiences, focusing more on the impact, versus technical colleagues, where they might detail the code and project logistics. Understanding these communication elements and tailoring your message accordingly sets you up for success in your future job.
## Top data professional communication practices
Communication is important. It flows through each stage of PACE, whether collecting data, constructing models or sharing results. Regardless of where you are within the PACE  framework, revision and clarification are part of a thoughtful analysis. Throughout the stages of  PACE, stakeholders can offer feedback, pose questions, or ask for clarification. Here are five best practices to guide your communications through any stage of the PACE framework.
### 1. Speak the language of your audience
Identify the needs of your audience. It is important to know the objectives of the person you are communicating with. Focusing on their needs allows you to gain insight and assess how technical the conversation should be. Consider the following questions:
-   Why has this person contacted you?
-   What does your stakeholder want from this interaction?
-   What’s important to them, their team, or their organization?
In your role as a data professional, you will interact with a variety of stakeholders. When speaking to another data professional, the exchange can go deeper into technical concepts. When sharing information with an executive who may not be familiar with those more technical aspects of your work, you need to consider what is important to someone in an executive role. Determine what they know, what they need to know, and what might go beyond their level of involvement in a project. 
-   Break down technical concepts into simpler terms. 
-   Use shorter sentences so main ideas are easier to understand and remember.
-   Use direct language and minimize embellishments or unnecessary detail.
-   Pay attention to diverse backgrounds and respect the lived experiences of others.

**Pro tip**: Avoid jargon, acronyms, and technical “buzzwords” that could lead to confusion.
### 2. Invite questions and welcome feedback
A data professional in the workplace must expect feedback and questions. Since your recommendations can have an impact on the future decisions of your company and its employees, it is natural to want your work to be perfect. The reality is that everyone can use feedback–whether it is positive or points out areas for improvement. When you are deep into a task, focused on the details, it is possible to overlook something. Feedback is essential since no single person can envision every possible perspective. Another person’s feedback offers you a great way to gather insights for your personal growth and professional excellence. By accepting the challenge that feedback and questions present, you will strengthen your own skills and help the overall project.
-   Merge your passion for finding solutions with the goals of the project.
-   Continue to strive for greater understanding of the results.
-   Elicit feedback and questions to improve communication about your projects.
-   Consider opportunities to reflect on your communication skills.

**Pro tip**: Analyze feedback. Is it valid? Does the person have a complete understanding of the goals of the project or data analytical process? If not, set up an additional meeting to help clarify.
### 3. Be the connection to the data
You are your team’s direct connection to the insights your data offers. Your goal is to help other stakeholders understand the process and how it addresses their needs. When everyone understands the process, communication can be highly effective.
-   Focus on the objectives to help others better understand your data process.
-   Tell the story of the data with a compelling and cohesive narrative.
-   Respond to questions in a timely manner.
-   Demonstrate your value to the team. 
-   Find opportunities to address stakeholder questions.

**Pro tip**: Continue to proactively identify ways the data and tools you have access to can address the objectives of your team and drive new insights.
### 4. Let your visualizations help tell the story
Visualizations are one of the best ways to communicate ideas, especially when dealing with big data. Visual references help bring to life the details inside your data. Graphs, charts and infographics can promote general understanding. Later you will explore Tableau, a visualization tool that you can use to create compelling visuals from data.
-   Be sure that your visuals tell the story within the data.
-   Design visualizations for inclusivity.
-   Use labels and text to clarify, not clutter. Use fonts that are easy to read.
-   Use high contrast, shading, and other customizations to communicate your messages clearly.
-   Offer handouts, slides, and other material in accessible formats.

**Pro tip**: Keep visualizations simple. When deciding what to include in a presentation, less is more.
### 5. Build positive professional relationships
When you consider the responsibilities and objectives of others, your communication will reflect that consideration. This builds credibility and influence in your workplace and allows you to continue growing throughout your career. 
-   Focus on what matters to your audience.
-   Invite feedback and discussion.
-   Be a trusted subject matter expert who communicates clearly and inclusively.
-   Cultivate positive interactions to strengthen working relationships and improve morale.

**Pro tip**: When you are contacted by a stakeholder, be accessible and engaged in your communication.

## Activity - Communicate with stakeholders in different roles
*You are a data analyst working for the National Parks Service*. One of the major concerns of this governmental agency is wildfires, which destroy an average of 7.4 million acres annually in the United States. The National Parks Service has created a data team to improve the predictability of wildfires. As a result, prevention efforts have been targeted more effectively and resources have been delegated to the appropriate areas.

*The agency set an internal goal for the wildfire predictive model of at least 90% accuracy*. The team’s final model consistently met this goal when running data from past years. As a direct result of the wildfire project, the prior prediction system was improved by 35% and helped wildfire prevention efforts globally. The results of this study are now referenced in numerous courses used to train firefighters, park rangers, and national park employees.

Your manager has asked you to email the following two new agency employees and give them an overview of the wildfire project:

-   A data analytics professional who will be working within your team. This person will need to know details about the data team’s workflow and relevant information required to maintain the accuracy of the wildfire project’s machine learning model. 
-   A writer for the agency’s public relations department. This person will need relevant information in order to create non-technical articles that promote the National Parks Service’s fire safety efforts.

# Communicate like data professional

## Communicate objectives with project proposal

### Elements of a project proposal
Each project proposal contains important information that a team will need to consider before work begins. Below is a brief explanation of some common sections you will find in project proposals. Note that the format of project proposals will vary, so not every section described here will be included in every project proposal.

**Project title:** The title of the project is prominent, usually placed near the top of a document. Effective titles are short and purposeful. Depending on the context and circumstance surrounding a project, the title on a project proposal can change over time.

**Project objective:** The objective statement is a one to three sentence explanation of what the project is trying to achieve.

**Milestones:** Milestones are groupings of tasks within a project, breaking the work needed into smaller, manageable goals. Milestones assist in the delegation and scheduling of work that needs to be completed within projects. 

- The milestones in the provided example are representing the end-of-course projects in future courses.    

**Tasks:** Tasks detail the work that needs to be completed within a milestone.

- In the provided example, the tasks parallel some of the work you will complete in future end-of-course projects.    

**Outcomes:** Outcomes are the completed actions or results that allow a project to continue.

**Deliverables:** Deliverables are items that can be shared amongst team members or with stakeholders. These are the end products of work undertaken for a project.

**Stakeholders:** The individuals or groups who are directly involved and have a vested interest in the success of a project. Input from stakeholders can serve as a basis for making decisions throughout a project.

**Estimated time:** At the beginning of a project, the time needed to complete milestones is estimated. As a project develops, these estimates will often need to be updated to account for adjustments to timelines or changes in team members.

# Building a portfolio ti impress
## The value of a portfolio
Experiential learning, or understanding through doing, is a key concept that involves immersing oneself in situations to practice and further develop skills. In the context of data analysis, experiential learning allows you to understand how data analysis is used in various industries and helps build self-confidence. This practice will be put to use in a portfolio project. A portfolio is a collection of materials that showcase one's abilities and can be shared with potential employers.

The portfolio project for this course involves using the PACE model to set up tasks. This will give you hands-on experience and will be particularly useful as companies often ask for such projects during the interview process to assess how a candidate approaches common business challenges.

Transferable skills, skills that can be used in various job roles or industries, will also be highlighted in this process. Examples include problem-solving, meeting deadlines, and organizational skills. These can be included in a PACE strategy document and reflected upon for their potential application in the data analysis field.

By the end of this process, you'll have a comprehensive set of artifacts for your portfolio, demonstrating your expertise across various tools and scenarios in the data career space.

## Introduction to your Course 1 end-of-course portfolio project
In job interviews at Google, portfolios are appreciated as they demonstrate a candidate's knowledge and capabilities in a clear format. They can set you apart from other candidates by showcasing your ability to understand business scenarios, communicate effectively, and use tools to solve complex problems. Thus far, you've learned about the role of data professionals, career paths, core analysis practices, and tools.

Your next step will be to apply this knowledge to a portfolio project. This involves understanding an organization, its stakeholders, and the business problem to be solved. You'll use the PACE model (Plan, Audience, Context, Execution) to create a strategy document outlining the project details and steps.

As you progress through the course, you'll continue to use the PACE model for your portfolio projects, refining your data analytics workflow. By the end, you'll have a comprehensive portfolio that showcases your skills and thought processes, making it an excellent talking point during interviews. It's now time to apply this knowledge and help organizations navigate through the world of data.

## End-of-course portfolio project introduction
Each course in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate concludes with a project that provides hands-on opportunities to practice your knowledge. These end-of-course portfolio projects build across courses to simulate the full lifecycle of a data project, just like job tasks that you will encounter as a data professional. 

After completing all of the courses in this certificate program, you are encouraged to compile the projects in a portfolio that highlights your data analytics skills. You will learn how to create a portfolio in the final course of this certificate program: [[Google Advance Data Analytics Capstone]]. In addition, the end-of-course projects can also be used to help you prepare for job applications and interviews since they showcase the valuable skills that you bring to the world of data analytics.
![[Pasted image 20230524192727.png]]

### Importance of communication in the data career space
End-of-course projects emphasize technical and professional workplace skills, as well as the importance of communication in data analytics. The success of your workflow management, data analysis, data visualizations, statistics, regression analysis, and building machine learning models relies on your ability to communicate with cross-functional team members. So, each project is designed to help you develop critical communication skills that you’ll need to use on the job in order to effectively: 
- Ask questions
- Share project needs
- Communicate with stakeholders
- Give and receive feedback
- Stay in contact with team members on the project

#### Expectations
As previously mentioned, you will encounter an end-of-course project in the final week of each course. The end-of-course projects were designed around a workplace scenario that will guide you through tasks that align with the concepts and skills you learned in each course. The workplace scenario extends across all of the certificate’s end-of-course projects.

You will be given the tools, resources, and instructions needed to apply your new skills and complete each individual end-of-course project.  Additionally, you’ll also have access to helpful resources designed to guide and inspire your data analysis workflow. In the end, your effort will be rewarded with work examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of your data analysis. If you get stuck at any point, there are links to review relevant information within each course.

To help you complete each end-of-course project, you will receive a PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute) strategy document to guide your workflow. As you answer the questions, you will gain a deeper understanding of the data analysis process, document your growth as a data professional, and prepare the observations and reflections needed to complete each project.

# Automatidata scenario
**Learn about the Course 1 Automatidata workplace scenario!**
The end-of-course project in Course 1 focuses on your ability to plan for data projects and create a project proposal. The end-of-course projects were designed with you in mind, offering an opportunity for you to practice and apply your data analytic skills. The materials provided here will guide you through discussions with co-workers, internal team members, and external stakeholders.

Opening your inbox, you notice an email from your supervisor, Deshawn.

**From:** Deshawn Washington

**Subject:** Review meeting notes

If you are able to read this, then your company accounts have been created! Now is the perfect time to get started. Last week, I attended an internal meeting with our leadership team about a new project we are about to begin. You’ll receive more information in the next few days, but I would like you to be aware of some needs that were identified by our leadership team. Here is an excerpt from the notes I took during the Automatidata leadership team meeting. I’ve organized the points by the person who made them.

**Uli King  (Senior Project Manager)**

- The data team will need a global-level project document to outline the goals and milestones.
    
- I am working closely with Titus Nelson over at the New York City Taxi and Limo Commission. He has requested some visuals to share with TLC’s executives.
    

**Luana Rodriquez (Senior Data Analyst)**

- The dataset from TLC has to be inspected before any analysis can begin. 
    
- Our team needs to determine what information the TLC data provides through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    
- Eventually, our team will need to test to find if the model is delivering consistent results.
    

**Udo Bankole (Director of Data Analysis)**

- Before we present any insights to TLC, we'll need to determine whether or not the model we produce meets the project requirements.
    
- Once we have a final model, I'll need to know the main talking points going into our presentation with TLC.
    

**My thoughts and concerns…**

- I think it's best to use Python for the TLC project. I'll have someone on my team set that up as soon as we have the plan in place.
    
- It will be important to establish the relationship between any variables within the TLC data. I'd suggest the data team consider A/B testing.
    

Review the meeting notes above to become familiar with the project’s context. I’ll ask you to identify project tasks and come up with a structure to guide the data team through this project. After our discussion about your experience in the certificate program offered by Google, I know that your efficient communication style and problem-solving will enhance the abilities of the data team. 

There will be more details sent to you very soon.

Welcome to the team,

Deshawn Washington
