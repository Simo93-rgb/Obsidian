L'astrazione più importante è RDD - Resilient Distribuited Dataset, a read-only, distributed collection of elements partitioned across a cluster of nodes that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way and that can be operated on in parallel
Properties:
- Immutable: once created, an RDD never changes
- Distributed: RDD is a logical unit from the point of view of the programmer, but internally Spark splits it in smaller partitions that are spread all around the cluster
- Resilient: an RDD can be reconstructed in the case some parts of it are lost
- Parallel: RDDs can be processed in parallel
